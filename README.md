<h2>What is SIT?</h2>
</div>

(Stay in Tarkov) is an Escape From Tarkov client and server module designed to be used with the SPT-AKI (Single Player Tarkov) server with the ultimate goal of "offline" Co-op-multiplayer.

<br>
<div align=center style="text-align: center">
<h2>Using the SIT Manager and patching your game files</h2>
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you attempt to install SIT, please update Tarkov through the BSG launcher and then start the game.
> Take note of your game version in the lower left corner of the screen. This version number is *extremely* important.

<br>
<br>

1. Make a new folder in your root directory: `C:\SIT`

2. Go to your `Escape from Tarkov` default installation path: *Usually* `C:\Battlestate Games` and copy the `EFT` folder to the folder you just made
 
3. Download the latest version of [SIT Manager](https://github.com/stayintarkov/SIT.Manager/releases/latest/)

4. Extract the `.zip`, open the `SIT.Manager` folder and copy the `Release` folder to `C:\SIT`

5. Rename `Release` to `Launcher`

6. Select a patcher [here](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/204-aki-patcher/#versions) that will downgrade the current version of your `C:\SIT\EFT` files to **Version 13.9.1.27622**

> [!NOTE]
> You may have to download multiple release to patch your current game version down to **Version 13.9.1.27622**.

<br>
<br>

7. Extract the `.zip`, copy `patcher.exe` and the `Aki_Patches` folder and paste them into `C:\SIT\EFT`
(so they are in the same folder as EscapeFromTarkov.exe)

8. Run `patcher.exe` *as an administrator* - the patching process will take several minutes

9. When the downpatcher has completed, open `C:\SIT\Launcher` and start `SIT.Manager.exe` as an administrator

10. Click `Settings` and configure your `EFT Path` to `C:\SIT\EFT`

11. Click `Tools` and then click `Install SIT`

<br>
<div align=center style="text-align: center">
<h2>Installing our modpack</h2>
</div>

1. Download the modpack [here](https://github.com/stahlfaust/stahlfaust.SIT.Co-op.Server/releases/latest/) and extract the `.zip`

2. Open the `Clientpack` folder

3. Drag and drop the `BepInEx` folder into your `C:\SIT\EFT` folder - click "Yes" to any prompts that require overwriting files


<br>
<div align=center style="text-align: center">
<h2>(Optional) Realistic Lighting mod</h2>
</div>

If you do not want to install Reshade, you can configure [Amands' Graphics](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/813-amands-s-graphics/) to your liking via the "F12" key

If you *would* like to install the Realistic Lighting for EFT mod, open the `(Optional) Realistic Lighting for EFT` folder and follow the installation instructions below

> [!NOTE]
> Amands' Graphics is already installed via the modpack. No need to follow step 3 of the instructions.
